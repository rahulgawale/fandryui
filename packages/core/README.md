# Fandry Core

Fandry Core provides foundational UI primitives for Fandry UI.

## Scope

Core includes:
- fd-* primitives
- extensible structure
- design tokens
- normalized semantic events

Core does not include:
- Salesforce-specific logic
- application behavior
- data access
- Flow integration
- layout systems

If a feature requires business context, it does not belong in Core.

## Stability

- APIs are experimental
- Breaking changes are allowed in v0.x
- Extensibility is prioritized over feature count
